# Final Remarks
This study highlights the potential of using a deep learning algorithm for interpreting seismic sections, particularly those of good to fair quality, interpretable by experts. Demonstrating success, the research discriminates simple structures on subsurface seismic sections using synthetic acoustic impedance images from legacy-interpreted cross-sections. Applicable to resource exploration, such as coal mines and oil and gas, the approach is cost-effective, utilizing legacy data for scalability. 

Future work
===========
Future studies should explore deep learning with low-resolution seismic images and complex structures, extending the methodology to distinguish between various geological features.
