The work contained in this paper contains work conducted during a PhD study undertaken as part of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Oil and Gas funded 50% through its National Productivity Investment Fund grant number NE/R01051X/1 and 50% by the University of Aberdeen through its PhD Scholarship Scheme. The support of both organisations is gratefully acknowledged. The work is reliant on Open-Source Python Libraries, particularly Pytorch, Detectron2, YOLO v7 and v8, and contributors to these are thanked, along with GitHub for open access hosting of the Python scripts for the study.
